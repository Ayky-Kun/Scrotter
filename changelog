0.9.7
- yttrium
 This is actually a major release, but because of constraints in old updater versions, it must be published as a minor release.
 Please update to this version as soon as possible so I can release new major versions.
   Added Drag & Drop support
   Added automatic rotation (for landscape devices)
   Major interface redesign:
	Hid "capture from Android" button
	Restructed the entire UI to be menu-driven rather than button-driven
	Changed loading bar to use an indeterminate (marquee) loading bar rather than Win8's loading circle
   Scrotter is now Large Address Aware (LAA).
      This means that x86 builds can use up to 3GB of RAM on 32bit systems, and up to 4GB on 64bit systems.
      This should resolve any "out of memory" (OOM) errors that happen when handling large arrays of very high resolution devices.
   There is also a memory usage counter in the top right since Scrotter manipulates large amounts of incredibly large images.
   Fixed long startup times (sometimes a failure to start) caused by myself forgetting to label versions properly on Github.
   Lots of updater fixes:
        Fixed text alignment on the updater window.
        Fixed the broken icon displayed for the updater window.
        Fixed license button displaying 400 error ever since the switch to LPPL from GPL.
